This Python script demonstrates basic data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library, primarily focusing on working with Pokemon data stored in different 
file formats (CSV, Excel, and text). 

The script begins by importing the Pandas library and then loads datasets from CSV, Excel, and text files. 
It then proceeds to access and manipulate the data through various techniques. 
These include reading specific columns and rows, locating data based on conditions (e.g., Pokemon with 'Fire' type or HP greater than 50), 
and sorting data based on different columns. 

Furthermore, it includes sections on making changes to the data, such as creating a new column 'Total' representing the sum of various stats, 
rearranging the order of columns, and dropping a specific column. Lastly, the script demonstrates saving the modified data into different file formats, 
including CSV, Excel, and text files.

In essence, this script showcases a workflow of loading, exploring, modifying, and saving data using Pandas. 
It provides a practical example of data manipulation techniques commonly used in data analysis and processing tasks.
